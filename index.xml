Remarks In OSCAL a profile represents a set of selected controls from one or more control catalogs. Such a set of controls can be referenced by an OSCAL system security plan (SSP) to establish a control baseline. This effective set of controls is produced from an OSCAL profile using a deterministic, predictable process called profile resolution.</description></item><item><title>OSCAL System Security Plan Model Development Snapshot JSON Format Metaschema Reference</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/develop/system-security-plan/json-definitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL-Reference/models/develop/system-security-plan/json-definitions/</guid><description>The following is a reference for the JSON object definitions derived from the metaschema for this model.
